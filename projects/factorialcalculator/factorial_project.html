		<h2>Factorial calculator || By Glitch &amp; DreemurrStar</h2>
		<h3>A program that calculates the factorial value of a positive Integer.</h3>
		<p>All Download links include Executables and Source-Code.</p>
		<h2>Factorial Calculator v4 (Java - 01/28/2019)</h2>
		<h4><br />DreemurrStar (My girlfriend) remembered that she could use the BigDecimal class to store infinite integers.<br />Now the program is RIDICULOUSLY MORE faster and simplefied.<br />Also now the result is saved in a text file next to executable folder.</h4>

		<h2>Factorial Calculator v3 (Java - 01/26/2019)</h2>
		<h4><br />DreemurrStar decided she wanted to get my logic and re-write the code in java.<br />C# is a lot similar to Java in many ways, so she didn't get any trouble doing that.<br />She made it more user-friendly and, because it's written in Java, it's a lot faster.</h4>

		<h2>Factorial Calculator v2 (C# - 01/25/2019)</h2>
		<h4><br />I decided that I really wanted to make my old factorial program faster.<br />So I re-wrote it C# and making the code less junkie and got better results.<br />For the user, it looks the same, but instead of using 2 files, a Module and a Class, now I use only a main class, so it can be compiled easier in any C# compiler.</h4>

		<h2>Factorial Calculator (VB.Net - 10/11/2018);</h2>
		<h4><br />Just a Random Program that I created to calculate Factorial numbers.<br />When I was doing it, I faced the problem of "Integer Limits".<br />I used the method of putting each number into a unique Integer, and do the maths one by one.<br />It was kinda slow but worked. I left it that way.</h4>
